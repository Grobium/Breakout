# Breakout
Simple Breakout Game made in C# using the MonoGame SDK

So I was trying to learn MonoGame/C# and got the Idea to try making a simple Breakout game.
If anyone wants to help me with that, feel free. But if you push code, please document what you are doing, becuase I am quite a noob. 

Planned are:
##Basic Gameplay mechanics:
*Collision with Platform
*Collision with Walls, Celing
*Collision with destructable objects (hereby referred to as blocks)
*Ball bounces off the plattform, angle determined by point on the platform the ball impacts on.
*Blocks destroyed __AFTER__ ball bounces off them.

##"Maybe if I have time" modular features:
*Controller Support (Optimised for Xbox 360)
*Sound
*Powerups maybe?
